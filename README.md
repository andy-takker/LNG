# LNG
In collaboration with an oil and gas departmentâ€™s student, I developed a program to compare the effectiveness of the LNG system and the gas pipeline in Jupyter Notebook. It allows customizing various indicators to simulate LNG and gas pipelines in order to calculate the total cost. The program is patented.
